An affordable and user friendly serious game for gross hand motion rehabilitation. 

The current code is mainly to test the game logic. The sensors being used are visible light sensors but the final version will use IR light sensors which may require a different calibration method in the code. Finally, the code is made for only two sensor inputs but the final version will have 4-5. 

Withgame_1 is the first draft of the gameplay that includes the bopit like timed game (has a bug in the timing). 

Withgame_2 the bug has been fixed. 

Withgame_3 the second game (a memory game) is being added. The option between game 1 and game 2 is separate startbutton for each game. The final version may have more than two games, therefore would switch to a mode button to change the game and then one start button.
